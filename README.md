# 🎨 AI Image Generation using ComfyUI  

## 📌 Overview  
This repository showcases AI-generated images created using Stable Diffusion models in ComfyUI. By leveraging advanced AI techniques like text-to-image generation and style conditioning, we bring artistic concepts to life with stunning visual fidelity.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies  
- ComfyUI – A powerful node-based interface for AI-powered image generation.  
- Stable Diffusion – The backbone AI model for creating high-quality, realistic images.  
- Prompt Engineering – Crafting highly detailed prompts to refine and control output quality.  

## 🚀 How to Recreate  
### 1️⃣ Install ComfyUI and Required Models  
Download and install ComfyUI from its official GitHub repository. Obtain a Stable Diffusion model (SD 1.5, SDXL, or a fine-tuned version) and place the model files in the `models/checkpoints/` directory. For additional features, you can also download LoRA models, VAE, or ControlNet.  

### 2️⃣ Load the Workflow in ComfyUI  
Open ComfyUI and set up a workflow by adding the required nodes. If using a pre-built workflow, simply drag and drop the `.json` file into ComfyUI. Make sure to include nodes for text-to-image generation, upscaling, and additional refinements.  

### 3️⃣ Define Prompts & Settings  
Write detailed prompts to generate precise image outputs (e.g., *"A futuristic cyberpunk city with neon lights, ultra-detailed"*). Use negative prompts to filter out unwanted elements (e.g., *"blurry, distorted, low-quality"*). Adjust parameters like sampling steps, resolution, and CFG scale to improve quality.  

### 4️⃣ Optimize Node Configurations  
Experiment with denoising strength to balance realism and creativity. Try different samplers like Euler or DPM++ 2M Karras to achieve unique styles. If you want structured compositions, use ControlNet or Depth maps for better control.  

### 5️⃣ Generate & Refine Images  
Click **Queue Prompt** to generate an image. If the result isn’t satisfactory, tweak prompt wording, model selection, or settings. Use img2img, inpainting, or upscaling to enhance the output further.  

## 📢 Future Enhancements  
- Experimenting with LoRA models for style transfer.  
- Using Depth and ControlNet for more structured compositions.  
- Fine-tuning prompts to achieve more diverse and realistic outputs.
